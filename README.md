# Queue
This project is a queue implementation in C Programming Language.

## Getting Started
You can download the entire project, and you'll have a full C project, which you can run on VS.
Another option is to download the executable of this code from Queue\Debug\Queue.exe

### Prerequisites
If you download the full project, you need a C compiler.
I suggest using Visual Studio [Youtube Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuR-54fQrA0)
Otherwise, using the executable, you only need a way to run .exe files.

## Running the code
There is not much to run.
It's a library you can add to your code, which will grant you a queue-like data structure.

## Built With
* [C Programming Language](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html) - The code language used
* [Visual Studio 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) - The compiler used.
